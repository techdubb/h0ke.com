I was spending too much time trying to determine what format my "year in review" post should take. At dinner today, my wife shared with us some New Year [worksheets](https://biglifejournal.com/collections/printables) she'd found online that we had each filled out last year. So, instead of making up some fancy format, I'll borrow it from the worksheet I filled out. 

### 2 - Two things I will get better at:
* French
	* This went well as I continued my fourth year of weekly French lessons and went another year without missing a single day on [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/profile/h0ke). It feels like I'm at a sort of intermediate plateau, but I'll keep trucking along. 
* Ukelele
	* Nothing to report here as I spent my "musical" time on the drums (see below).

### 0 - Something I want to do less of:
* Eat fewer carbs
	* This went OK... sometimes. I have a feeling this is going to be a lifelong goal of mine. ðŸ˜…

### 2 - Two things I want to learn:
* How to make furniture
	* I didn't end up doing any large pieces for the house, but I did make a laying box and "mobile" roosting bars for our chickens. Also, a squatty potty. 
* How to play drums
	* I did end up buying the [Alesis Nitro Mesh 8-Piece Electronic Drum Set](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Alesis/Nitro-Mesh-8-Piece-Electronic-Drum-Set-1500000219380.gc), which was a good start. I haven't done any formal lessons yet, but I've been practicing some [rudiments](https://vicfirth.zildjian.com/education/40-essential-rudiments.html), off and on, and got a few grooves mostly worked out.

### 1 - One new thing I want to try:
* Reading one book per month
	* This did... not go well. I wasn't able to find a consistent time through most of the year which worked for reading. I finally pulled it together in the last 3 months of 2021 and eked out [3 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/26124780). I shall try again this year for a book a month. 

Additionally, I spent ~45min [reviewing last year's calendar](https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/) (week-by-week) and last year's photos. Here is a sample of highlights I pulled from this exercise.

* We harvested some excellent food from our garden. ![green cabbage](cabbage.jpg) ![garlic scapes](garlic-scapes.jpg) <hr/> ![potatoes](potatoes.jpg) ![leeks](leeks.jpg)
* We got excellent food from our [CSA](http://www.girardfarm.com/)!
* The rain brought some awesome fungi. <br/> ![mushroom](mushroom01.jpg) ![mushroom](mushroom02.jpg) <hr/> ![mushroom](mushroom03.jpg) ![mushroom](mushroom04.jpg)
* I participated in a 6-month [Mindful Leadership Practicum](https://www.startuppatterns.com/video-library/advanced-practicum-showcase-2021) that helped me start [thinking and writing about management](https://techdubb.medium.com/) (and related topics).
* Some fawns lived by our house for a few months! ![baby deer](deer.jpg)
* I started bidding in online Estate Sales. It's sort of odd, but it's a good way to get some great second hand items for cheap (sometimes).
* Somewhat rare Pink Lady's Slipper flowers grow on our property. ![lady slipper](lady-slippers.jpg)
* And, in general, all sorts of good time outside alone, with family and with friends.

If you've made it this far, thanks for reading. Let's see what 2022 has in store for us.
