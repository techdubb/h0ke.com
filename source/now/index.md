#### What am I doing now?

That's a great question! This idea was *borrowed* from [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff). I'm spending my time...

* being the father of [small](http://lucashokanson.com) [people](http://nadinehokanson.com).

* as an engineering manager at [ezCater](https://www.ezcater.com).

* reading [a few books](https://hardcover.app/@techdubb/books/currently-reading).

* [listening](https://armchairexpertpod.com/flightless-bird) [to](https://www.podpage.com/mike-birbiglias-working-it-out/) [a](https://discgolf.ultiworld.com/podcast/the-upshot/) [few](https://www.theringer.com/plain-english-with-derek-thompson-podcast) [podcasts](https://armchairexpertpod.com/).
