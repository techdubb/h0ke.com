I assumed it was going to be difficult and require me to Google several steps along the way.\n\nWhen I got the email saying my e-book was ready, I clicked the link and was forwarded to a special section of the library's site. I selected my desired type of e-book (Kindle edition) and clicked the 'Checkout' button. I was forwarded to Amazon's lending page and asked to log in. After entering my credentials, I clicked another button and sure enough, the book was instantly downloading on my Kindle.\n\n“This is amazing,” I thought to myself. “We really _won't_ need physical libraries in the future.”\n\nA lot’s been said about the future of public libraries. What's going to happen when everyone is bumbling around with e-readers and there's no more use for physical books? This question usually sparks a heated yet hushed debate between an Oculus wearing techno-fiend and the nearest “I'll never read a book on a device!” luddite.\n\nI've realized that this discussion misses the mark.

I've tried. I really have. When I was young, I would spend entire summer days in a friend’s basement playing SimCity, Doom and all the other great games of the 90s. Even then, once summer sessions started for soccer, I would haul out of the basement, grab my gear and run to the field.\n\nThroughout high school, I didn't play video games. There was a brief stint of playing Dungeons & Dragons, but that was only when it was too hot or rainy to play street hockey.\n\nOnce I got to college, the only draw to video games was the blazing fast campus network. Most of my focus on Unreal Tournament and Counterstrike was fed by being surrounded by other people who were also avoiding work. However, the majority of my time in college was spent in class, doing work or socializing with actual humans.\n\nAfter college I headed to Steamboat Springs, CO and played no games, unless you count the ones that involve alcohol. The ski town life was all consuming: snowboarding, mountain biking, hiking, drinking craft beer and dabbling in other mind altering particulars.\n\nWhen I moved back to Maine, I played video games since my good friend and roommate was an avid gamer. The PS3 had stepped up the graphics quality and online gameplay, so I found myself deep into Warhawk and watching other people play Fallout.\n\nEventually I moved out to California and though I owned a PS3, I didn't use it much. I bought it to play against/with my younger brother back in Maine. It also happened that I worked at game company where most everyone was a huge gamer. I thought it would help me fit in at work, but it didn't. I eventually sold it.\n\nOccasionally in downtime I'll poke at a mobile game, but even then I don't quite find myself having fun.\n\nSeveral months ago, I knew my son was on the way and was advised to have some entertaining games ready to play while standing with said child sleeping in a carrier. I hopped onto Steam and bought a few new games that looked good. I even went as far as buying a game controller for maximum standing gameplay.\n\nSo here I am, laptop loaded up with games, controller accessible and barely able to bring myself to start, let alone finish a video game. At the end of the day I'd rather be reading, programming or spending time with my family.\n\nI don't begrudge folks who like games.

I have [thoughts on pants](https://twitter.com/search?q=%40h0ke%20pants&src=typd).\n\nMy body type can be best described as ‘husky,’ to use the early '90s parlance. While I wish clothing manafaturers would cut pants that fit me, I totally understand that my proportions are not… average.\n\nHere's the problem:\n\n  * If I get the right waist measurement, the inseam and rise are too long.\n  * If I get the correct inseam and rise, I can _maybe_ fit my left quad into the waist.\n\nThis has been my reality to date.\n\nA couple years ago, the Gap started making a 34 in. waist pant that fits me less terribly than any other non-custom pant. The inseam is a bit long at 30 in. and the rise provides a look best described as “saggy britches.” However, I’ll take what I can get and ameliorate the situation using a sturdy belt and rolled cuffs. [^1]\n\nOver the last month, I decided something had to change. In pondering what could be done, I remembered a podcast from late last year. It was an episode of freakanomics called, \"[How Did the Belt Win?](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/how-did-the-belt-win-a-new-freakonomics-radio-episode/)“ \n\nThe main thread (see what I did there) was that belts and suspenders have gone back in forth as the dominant leader in the “plumber’s crack avoidence” market.There is talk of fashion trends, wedgie avoidal, monarchical mandate, sword belts, modern social norms and even concerns of cutting into the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve like a tourniquet.\n\nWith this in mind, I decided to give suspenders a go, social norms be damned. I picked a [relatively cheap pair](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NUZTVXO?tag=30daydel-20) for the experiment, and waited for the two days shipping (#firstnerdproblems)\n\nOnce they arrived, I quickly tried them on. Lo and behold: They looked **ridiculous**.\n\nThe suspenders accentuated my dad gut and placed the waistline of the pants roughly two inches higher than normal.\n\nAfter taking a deep breath, I realized that the higher waistline actually provided the pant fit I was looking for. The hem of my pants fell where I wanted and the \"saggy britches\" morphed into “there might be an ass in there.\" The suspenders actually made these untailored, readily available pants fit.\n\nOk, but what to do about the whole upper half of my wardrobe making me look like an over-fed mountain dwarf?\n\nThe solution unvailed an unintended benefit of the suspender experiment. It was decided I was to wear a decent sweater or button down shirt to cover the suspenders. Now I had a decent top and pants that fit! If only my mother could see me now! [^2]\n\nI’ve always rejected the notion that dressing well impacts your mood. But I must say that standing there in my apartment, giving myself a once over, I felt much more… well… adult.

I shall try again this year for a book a month. </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, I spent ~45min <a href=\"https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">reviewing last year’s calendar</a> (week-by-week) and last year’s photos. Here is a sample of highlights I pulled from this exercise.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We harvested some excellent food from our garden. <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/cabbage.jpg\" alt=\"green cabbage\"> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/garlic-scapes.jpg\" alt=\"garlic scapes\"> <hr/> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/potatoes.jpg\" alt=\"potatoes\"> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/leeks.jpg\" alt=\"leeks\"></li>\n<li>We got excellent food from our <a href=\"http://www.girardfarm.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CSA</a>!</li>\n<li>The rain brought some awesome fungi. <br/> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/mushroom01.jpg\" alt=\"mushroom\"> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/mushroom02.jpg\" alt=\"mushroom\"> <hr/> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/mushroom03.jpg\" alt=\"mushroom\"> <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/mushroom04.jpg\" alt=\"mushroom\"></li>\n<li>I participated in a 6-month <a href=\"https://www.startuppatterns.com/video-library/advanced-practicum-showcase-2021\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mindful Leadership Practicum</a> that helped me start <a href=\"https://techdubb.medium.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">thinking and writing about management</a> (and related topics).</li>\n<li>Some fawns lived by our house for a few months! <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/deer.jpg\" alt=\"baby deer\"></li>\n<li>I started bidding in online Estate Sales. It’s sort of odd, but it’s a good way to get some great second hand items for cheap (sometimes).</li>\n<li>Somewhat rare Pink Lady’s Slipper flowers grow on our property. <img src=\"/posts/2021-in-review/lady-slippers.jpg\" alt=\"lady slipper\"></li>\n<li>And, in general, all sorts of good time outside alone, with family and with friends.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading.
